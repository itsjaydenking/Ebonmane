        <h2>PLAYERS AND A GAME MASTER</h2>
        <p>
          LOST OMENS RPG needs any number of players, from two or more. One
          player takes Game Master (GM) while the others create a legend called
          a Player Character (PC). The players’ characters are the focus of the
          story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players make decisions, roll dice, and engage with the story through
          these characters. Each player has a character sheet to record states,
          abilities, and essential details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-player characters (NPCs) act as allies, bystanders, and even
          adversaries to the PCs. The GM creates and controls these NPCs.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s explore all this in more depth.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>THE GAME MASTER</h2>
        <p>
          One player at the table must be responsible as the GM. The GM portrays
          NPCs, advances the plot, and decides the chain of events. It’s an
          important job.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GM sets up scenes for characters to explore and help manage
          interactions. Player character actions shape the game through
          overcoming challenges and rolling dice. The GM interprets rules, such
          as deciding the Difficulty of a Test or unusual situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GM is not an enemy of the player characters. The game works best
          when the GM fans the player characters and their legends. The GM works
          to make the characters’ lives as dramatic and exciting as possible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>DICE</h2>
        <p>
          Lost Omens RPG uses six-sided dice, known as d6s, and twelve-sided
          dice, known as d12s. These dice are to resolve the actions characters
          may try. Rolling dice usually includes more than one at a time. Dice
          pools refer to these collective dice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Six-sided dice resolve Tests and roll for most tables. Sometimes,
          twelve-sided dice reflect a more remarkable aptitude for the test or
          complex tables. Rolls often include two or more d6s and d12s. Having
          at least five d6s and five d12s for each player is helpful.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>REROLLS</h2>
        <p>
          A player may re-roll one or more dice of their choice. The new result
          replaces the original, even if it is worse. Players may always keep
          their original result instead of re-rolling.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>PAPER AND PENCILS</h2>
        <p>
          Paper and pencils are useful for maps, writing essential things, and
          tracking moments. You can write notes about temporary effects on your
          characters, the names of people you meet, essential events, and clues
          to help you in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Game Master may also use paper and pencils to remember details
          about characters and important game parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use tablets, smartphones, or computers to keep track of
          everything, but some people might find them distracting.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>TOKENS AND PERIPHERALS</h2>
        <p>
          You’ll need tools to track different things in the game. Players need
          six tokens for Harmony, and the Game Master needs around twelve for
          Chaos. These are resources in the game. Players might also want extra
          tokens for Hope, which are unique to each character. You can use
          chips, coins, beads, counters from other games, or random items.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>BASIC IDEAS</h2>
        <p>
          A few core ideas and a basic primer on the most common mechanics are
          present throughout the rules.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>CHARACTERS</h2>
        <p>
          Each player has a character and is one of the game’s protagonists.
          These and many Non-player characters (NPCs) the Game Master (GM)
          controls have common elements. These elements help describe their
          abilities.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>ATTRIBUTES</h3>
        <p>
          A character’s Attributes stand for a character’s core abilities. They
          express how capable a character is in specific actions. Each character
          has three attributes: Body, Mind, and Soul.
        </p>
        <p>Each attribute has a rating from 1 – 6.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>APPROACHES</h3>
        <p>
          A character’s Approaches stand for a character’s training and
          understanding. They express how effective a character is in a specific
          method of action. Each character has three approaches: Force, Finesse,
          and Focus.
        </p>
        <p>Each approach has a rating from 0 – 4.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>SPECIALITIES</h3>
        <p>
          A character’s Specialties stand for a character’s inclinations and
          habits. They express how particular a character is in a specific
          action. Nine specialties exist based on the total possible
          combinations of Attribute + Approach.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>TALENTS</h3>
        <p>
          A character has Talents, which are abilities and traits gained over
          their life.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>SCENES</h2>
        <p>
          The scene is the fundamental unit of any adventure. Shows, movies, and
          books also encapsulate these continuous sequences of action.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of a scene, the Game Master (GM) tells the characters
          where they are, what's happening, and anything else important. The
          scene usually has a purpose. The characters search for a clue or look
          for someone based on what happened before.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>ACTIVE SCENES</h3>
        <p>
          After the GM describes the scene, the characters can ask questions and
          decide what to do. They can move around, talk to others involved, and
          more. Once they finish their actions or have a new goal that takes
          them somewhere else, the scene ends, and a new one starts. The
          characters' choices matter. Character actions affect the world, and
          they have to deal with the results of their decisions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>TESTS</h3>
        <p>
          Characters have the autonomy to do things when a scene happens. Some
          actions are easy, and the Game Master (GM) immediately approves them.
          Others, because of the character's truths or situation, are
          impossible. But there's a middle ground where things are uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this uncertain area, tests come up to decide if characters succeed
          or fail. First, a character tells the GM what they want to do. The GM
          then looks at the situation to see if it's possible or requires a
          Test.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GM gives the player three key details if the action requires a
          Test. The key details are the relevant Attribute, the Approach, and
          the Difficulty.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>MAKING A TEST</h3>
        <p>
          The GM determines the Difficulty of the Test on a scale of 0 to 5.
          Most actions a character attempts are within their capabilities with a
          Difficulty 1. More complicated or risky actions may increase the
          Difficulty +1 or more. Certain situations or advantages may decrease
          the Difficulty by 1, to a minimum of 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          A character sheet notes the character's Attributes and Approaches.
          Adding these values together decides how many dice the player rolls.
          The player gathers the relevant number of d6s. The player may need
          more dice or even a few d12s depending on character features.
        </p>
        <p>
          They roll the dice and assess each one. Any roll equal to or greater
          than '6' counts as a success! Any dice that rolls equal to or greater
          than '10' scores two successes instead of one success. A dice can
          score no more than two successes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The player sets aside any dice that rolls a Natural 1. They’ll be
          significant.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>SUCCESS OR FAILURE</h3>
        <p>
          The player adds together all the successes they scored. If the total
          equals or exceeds the Difficulty, they’ve succeeded at the Test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each success beyond the Difficulty earns the player character Harmony.
          This is a resource to spend and improve the outcome of the Test
          (explained later). The player may save some or all the Harmony
          generated to use later.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the player scored fewer successes than the difficulty, they’ve
          failed the Test.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any of these cases, the GM describes what happens to the player
          character.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>COMPLICATIONS</h3>
        <p>
          The GM notes any 1s rolled after describing the outcome. Each '1' is a
          single Complication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complications are a problem that occurs during the Test but resolves
          after it. Complications don't turn a success into a failure. Player
          characters usually must contend with extra challenges or consequences
          from Complications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GM can save the problem for later and generate one point of Chaos
          instead (explained later).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>HARMONY</h2>
        <p>
          Player characters generate Harmony scoring more successes than needed
          on a Test. Each extra success becomes a single point of Harmony.
          Player imagination and Game Master (GM) permission are the limits to
          what Harmony can do.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>SPENDING HARMONY</h3>
        <p>
          Spending Harmony allows a player to turn a mere success into glorious
          triumphs. There are several common ways to spend Harmony.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deal more damage.</li>
          <li>Alter the scene to capitalize on later.</li>
          <li>Ask the GM questions about the situation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Unused Harmony after a Test resolve adds to the group's collective
          pool.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>KEEPING HARMONY</h3>
        <p>
          A party can have up to six points of Harmony saved up at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a player character succeeds at a Test, they may spend Harmony
          from the group pool. Harmony spending can come from the pool with or
          instead of Harmony generated from a Test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, the party may not have enough Harmony to achieve its goals.
          A player character can take risks and generate Chaos instead of
          spending Harmony. Chaos is the GM's version of Harmony.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>CHAOS</h2>
        <p>
          The Game Master (GM) has a resource called Chaos, the counterpart to
          Harmony. Chaos stands for unknown challenges, perils, and everything
          that could go wrong. The GM spends Chaos to change things in the
          current scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GM also spends Chaos to the advantage of Non-player character
          (NPC) adversaries. Spending Chaos on adversaries works the same way a
          player character spends Harmony. The GM instead generates Chaos for
          their pool when adversaries would generate Harmony.
        </p>
        <p>
          Player characters may generate Chaos when they are out of Harmony and
          need leverage. The Chaos pool may also grow because of Complications
          on Tests.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>HOPE</h2>
        <p>
          Player characters have access to a personal resource called Hope. Hope
          stands for the elements that make them stand out. Player characters
          may spend Hope to upgrade dice in their dice pool or reroll dice that
          have failed them. Hope also helps characters avoid injuries or other
          consequences during an action scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spending Harmony, generating Chaos, or taking a rest all restores
          spent Hope. When Hope drops to zero, a character becomes hopeless.
          This can take a few different forms, but they all stand for a problem
          for the character.
        </p>
