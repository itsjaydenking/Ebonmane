CHAPTER 
LEGENDS AND LEGACIES
Forget the Past, Remember the Future
FORGED IN LIGHT AND SHADOW 
Once, Hiraeth was a battleground. Humans lived under the tyranny of dragons, giants, and elementals. Then, a star fell, bringing the Terrans and their strange energy – the Grim Light. This light empowered some, granting magical abilities, and birthed the Erathans. With their newfound power, the Erathans fought back, reclaiming Hiraeth.

FADING LIGHT
This victory came at a cost. The Grim Light seeped into the land, forming powerful crystals called Grim Forges. Each Forge offered unique powers, shaping four distinct societies: the Revenites, experts in death; the Technocrats, tech-wizards; the Mythoterics, monster tamers; and the Aethernauts, weavers of magic. These factions clashed, vying for dominance.

EVERLASTING NIGHT
The arrival of the Ark, a colossal Terran vessel, fractured the world further. Its fragments amplified magic and technology, while its crash site promised ultimate power. The threat of Light Eaters emerged during this scramble. Grim Light drew these creatures in waves. The creatures devour light, plunging Hiraeth into the Everlasting Night and desperate factions.

A NEW DAWN
In a final effort, the Keepers of the Grim Forges united. Unleashing their full might, they shattered the Light Eater hive, breaking the darkness. But their victory came at a terrible price. Erupting Grim Forges devastated the land and left only faint echoes of their power. Hiraeth gained freedom but carried the scars.

LINGERING DARKNESS
Under the fragile dawn, remnants of the Grim Forges whisper forgotten secrets. Hiraeth's heroes set to rebuild their world. They navigated the echoes of darkness and the lingering threat of Light Eaters. The world is a canvas with the brilliance of hope and the smudges of past conflicts. Only time may reveal what blooms from the ashes of the Grim Light.
 

LEGENDS OF THE YESTER
The world lives on, trying to forget the dread of the past. This is a means to remember their dreams for the future. 

PRIMEVAL DOMINANCE
Approximately half a millennium prior, this world was bound in an endless conflict. Dragons, Giants, Elementals, and other horrors forced people to serve in their domains. The humanoids living on the land suffered the most as the daily circumstances were dire. 
The world known as Earth faced similar circumstances. Due to diminishing resources, corporations, pandemics, and hazardous climates made people suffer. Humans were on the road to self-destruction and sought refuge among the stars.

THE GRAND UPHEAVAL
One day, the night sky exploded, and a star streaked across. Fragments of shimmering metal broke free and rained along the path of descent. A small collection of individuals followed the star to its point of impact. They discovered a sizeable and destroyed metallic coffin shaped like a flower. Devastated bodies surrounded the structure, which had a glow matched by a low humming. Two figures in the coffin clung to life and spoke with the people who discovered them.
The figures of the coffin referred to themselves as "Terran." They came from a place called "Terra Earth." Denizens of this world repeated, claiming this world was "Hiraeth." Some theorize that they were speaking that this world was "Here, Earth."
The "Terrans" spoke of their arrival. They traveled upon a gargantuan vessel, the Ark Garden Evera. Evera was humanity's 4th attempt at terraforming another world. Erath had been fading; thus, they embarked on finding new potential. Something occurred upon Evera that forced an ejection of the stasis pod, an Ark Petal.
Those who discovered the pod treated the wounded and settled around the Ark Petal and its light. The Ark petal began to affect the world's people. The light unlocked the natural magical influences of Hiraeth and granted power.
The Terrans described the device's power source as a form of "New Clear Energy." The energy radiated a Grim Light, providing hope but with consequences. 

RECLAMATION
Grim Light affected all humanoids and manners of the beasts that settled near the Petal. Those within the vicinity of the debris felt similar effects. Those struck by the fragments experienced more visceral effects if they survived. 
Any that survived the effects of Grim Light claimed themselves as Erathan. They used this energy to contest the primeval entities and wrestle the land from their grasp. Memories of Terra began to flow through those who wielded the Grim Light during the conflict.
The world overcame its primeval bonds and moved toward victory and beyond. The Terran, Lumen, aided in forging a society influenced by science and magic. The New Clear energy and Grim Light byproduct seeped into the land. The influence began to stir something beneath the planet's surface and awoke something. 

GRIM FORGES
New Clear energy began to condense and crystallize into hardened substances worldwide. These crystals gave fuel to manifest magical effects and power autonomous machinery. Daemonata refers to the crystals, which call to the essence of something greater. This resource gave people the means to progress society further. 
Creatures in the wild evolved due to the influence of New Clear energy. Portions of their body held fragments of Daemonata that shattered upon death. Such creatures claimed the name of Daemon Hearts, suffused with Grim Light. 
Exploration revealed a few distinct super crystals emitting vibrant Grim Light. These crystals existed in atriums formed out of nature itself. Their light called to people and summoned them to appear before them. These large Daemonata did more than provide a simple source of energy. Instead, they granted untold powers that rivaled the land's ancient primeval. People learned from and pulled upon the power hidden within these crystals. 
Individuals appealed to the Grim Light to manifest their desires. The crystals seemed to respond if the requests met specific conditions. As such, these crystals crafted spectacular effects through the Grim Light. Thus, the super crystals of condensed Daemonata established the Grim Forges.

REVENITES AND THE OBSIDIAN JEWEL
The first prominent Grim Forged identified was that of the Obsidian Jewel. This crystal bestowed a deeper connection and understanding with death in all forms. They learned to manipulate the nature of death and alter the balance of life. Such a power came to be the essence of Revenance. Through this power, the denizens of the Obsidian claimed the name Revenites. Despite the inclination toward death, Revenites revered eternal life. 

TECHNOCRATS AND THE COBALT JEWEL
Following the Obsidian Jewel came the discovery of the Cobalt Jewel. This crystal bestowed influence over technology and the power to craft like no other. They created the Cyber Forge process through their distinct technological prowess. They learned to grant limited sentience to constructs to aid in crafting. Automation of machines with near-infinite potential became commonplace for the Technocrat society.

AETHERNAUTS AND THE CARMINE JEWEL
The Carmine Jewel revealed itself during a global conflict of the Grim Forges. This crystal bestowed unrestricted power of magic upon its people. Beyond invocations, they learned to create artifacts from the same magic. Such a process came to knowledge as Rune Forging. The Aethernauts navigated magic to overwhelm and outclass most enemies in their path.

MYTHOTERICS AND THE AMBER JEWEL
Grim Forge presented itself before experiencing Grim Sublimation. In this process, a Daemonata explodes due to overwhelming energy. The effect of such a crystal destroyed much of the region and left no identified survivors. Only monstrous abominations remained in the ruins of what was a Grim Forge. Exploration of the rubble revealed a Grim Forge, the Amber Jewel. This crystal bestowed a power different than most others. Those who clung to the Amber Jewel unlocked their limitations with monstrous results. They understood their former nature, and the Mythoterics guarded this dark history.





















ARK VESSELS
Amid a rising conflict, the sky shimmered with dozens of lights falling towards the planet. Each one shined like the story of the first that arrived during primeval dominance. One light shone brighter than those before it and even that of the Grim Forges. The force of the crashing light rivaled that of Grim Sublimation. There was no question that such a structure radiated with grand New Clear energy.
The smaller fragments that fell were the easiest to uncover and investigate at once. Each fragment, no matter how small, could amplify the powers bestowed by the Grim Forges. As such, the hunt began for the pieces of Evera. Members of the various factions expedited to find the impact point for the Ark. 
The goal was to claim power for themselves. People scoured the world for fragments of the Ark and the Petals that fell from the sky. 

ARK RIFTS
The discovery and application of Ark Remnants caused strange events worldwide. Magic surges, unprecedented weather phenomena, and monstrous magical mutations everywhere. Even the technology created became unstable and unpredictable around these random surges. 
Expeditions for Ark Remnants discovered Ark Rifts. Strange cracks, and even tears, in the very fabric of reality. Collaboration among factions revealed that the Ark Garden came through a Rift. The world that the first Terrans came from existed in a different realm and time altogether. 
Many saw the Rifts as an opportunity for power and influence. Factions came together to create a discovery program known as the Grim Expedition. This was the first time since the discovery of the Grim Forges that so many factions came together. The expedition would travel where rifts open and determine what exists on the other side.

THE FADING LIGHT
Not all were keen to dive deeper into these results. A major faction abandoned all Grim Forges and their products. They limited their contact with New Clear energy and its Grim Light. They made communities that were not dependent on Grim Forges and claimed to be true Erathans.
After a failed expedition, beings and entities from beyond the Rifts appeared. Some recognized the rift phenomena as the effects of other realms crashing into this one. The appearance of creatures with a darkened glow halted any research on the Rifts. The entities were not malicious but hungry for the Grim Light that existed. 
These creatures feed on sources of magic, uses of technology, and even the bodies of the living and dead. The power of Grim Light used for society became sustenance for these monsters. Light Eaters became the only way to describe these creatures with an event horizon.

EVERLASTING NIGHT
Only a dozen Light Eaters arrived initially, but they proved challenging, nonetheless. Time gave the Light Eaters a terrifying edge in their rate of multiplying. They continued this proliferation from hundreds into the hundreds of thousands. Light Eaters threatened the world as they multiplied, bringing about the Night Parade. Their radiating darkness consumed the sky itself, creating the Everlasting Night.
The Light Eaters did more than kill things that got in their way. They consumed people's Grim Light and left them filled with nightmarish despair. The very nature of their presence drained positivity from the people. 
Factions ceased conflict with one another and focused their efforts on survival. Some factions and dissenters believed the Light Eaters were a blessing of the Forges. Others believed they could tame and control these aberrant monsters. The most extreme worshiped them and their Pleasant Darkness.
The known world discovered the source of the Light Eaters through dire efforts. They discerned that the power of the Light Eaters mimicked where the Ark Garden crashed. Many believed the Light Eaters resulted from a twisted Grim Forge derived from the Ark. The world over felt their time waning, unable to endure the onslaught of creatures. Their destructive power left ruins and demoralized most. 

A NEW DAWN
Leaders of various communities came together and decided to end their conflicts. The priority became the Light Eaters and the survival of the known world. Keepers of the Grim Forges and other prominent members of power draw on every ounce of New Clear energy. The result was a torrent of power upon the interconnected hive of the Light Eaters. Monstrous humanoids, gargantuan mechs, meteoric spells, and droves of undead assaulted the Hive.
The assault was successful, but every Grim Forged used experienced a Grim Sublimation. The result was cataclysmic eruptions that devastated much of the remaining societies. The force of such might through the Grim Light broke through the darkness, blanketing the sky. A Grim Dawn had arrived.
A new dawn had arrived, and the Light Eaters were all but eliminated. With the hive destroyed, many of the remaining were weak in comparison. Areas, where people slung spells, built machines, and defied death, became nests. Only fragments, remnants even, of the Grim Forges remain. The Grim Light dwindled to a faint spark in people once bound by their crystals. 




LORE OF THE CURRENT
Almost 150 years have passed since the Grim Dawn, and now the world is under a kind of darkness called Grim Dusk, a milder form of the Dusk Plague. This darkness causes people to slowly lose their light and hope. As a result, younger generations are becoming increasingly crucial for the world's progress and survival.
The motto "Forget the Past, Remember the Future" encourages everyone to prioritize empowering the world and reclaiming what was lost during the Everlasting Night. It's about moving away from the painful past and looking forward to a better future.

BEYOND THE ARK RIFTS
Certain regions of the known world have sudden tears in the fabric of reality. These are identified as the Ark Rifts and connect to unknown worlds. People that approach these may find themselves in foreign realms. Others may discover otherworldly beings breaching the rift into this world.
Dozens of worlds are available to this one with opportunities to encounter fantastical lands. Some people may even have been from one of these other worlds, lost in this one or left as a child. 


LEGECY OF THE MORROW
In the land of Hiraeth, a century has passed since Grim Dawn finally defeated the darkness. Hiraeth is filled with amazing technology and magical artifacts from Grim Forges. Using too much powerful light can attract dangerous creatures such as Light Eaters.

CREATIONS FROM GRIM FORGES
The Grim Forges allows the creation of incredible things. Only Daemons and other trained experts understand Grim Forges and their products. Grim Forge creations are too complicated for most people.

EVERYDAY LIFE IN HIRAETH
The average Erathan uses basic technology and common magical items daily. They try to use only what is necessary to live well and avoid attracting the Light Eaters' anger. Commoners respect the environment and make use of solar panels or wind turbines. 

LIGHT FORGES, NEW ENERGY SOURCES
Grim Forges are not the only asset used for creating powerful objects. Artificial structures described as Light Forges exist using less Grim Light than expected. These forges can make technological wonders and magical blessings. Finding a Light Forge is rare since they replicate ancient powers. Only a few people can use them, and they likely will attract dangerous creatures.

WEAPONS AND ARMOR
People in Hiraeth use various weapons like knives, bows, and spears. Some have special weapons like Cyber and Rune Forged items. Cyber Forging uses a special mineral for advanced technology. While Rune Forged uses a unique wooden material for magic. 
Armor is also diverse, from simple scraps to more advanced gear. Only those with enough Grim Light can use the technical gear without problems.

FORGED KNOWLEDGE
There are beings called Daemons who hold and protect the power of Grim Forges. These Daemons share their knowledge with certain people. The collected knowledge scattered the known world when the Grim Forges erupted. Now those who use Grim Light may claim the details that Daemons knew. There's a chance the lost information might destroy darkness and restore light.

 
 
REMNANT FACTIONS
The arrival of Light Eaters destroyed the world order. Some chose to fight against the threat while others had no choice but to defend to survive. Most of the population decided to find shelter and hope to outlast the darkness. New communities bloomed from the broken structure of society. Each one formed with newfound beliefs, laws, and ways of living 150 years later.  

 
ERATHANS
“Do what you can with what you have. Make do with less if you can, never use more than you need. This is how you avoid self-imposed catastrophes.”
Erathans are resourceful and adaptable. They were the first to harness the Grim Light and abandon that same power. Their ideals establish comfort in living within their means and avoid pushing boundaries. Settlements founded by Erathans have stood since the occurrence of Grim Dawn. This means that Erathan settlements are the longest-standing and most stable communities.
Erathan settlements focus on plain lifestyles and admonish large-scale magic and technologies. Despite their distaste, Erathans are quite proficient in those same subjects. Denizens can apply distinct knowledge from a range of expertise.
These communities are more likely to have grand settlements with a diverse population. They accept people from all factions while keeping leadership within their ranks. The intention is to avoid conflicts with Grim Light that once affected the Grim Forges. It is common for an Erathan community to maintain a level of small close-knit individuals. This includes those who abandoned their crystal heritage or seeking a freer life.
 
REVENITES
“Everyone dies, but few people ever actually live. Go where the world takes you and gather the stories discarded by the flow of time. Weave your tale into the fabric of history."
Revenites called upon legions of lost warriors, mages, and visionaries. Through Anastasis, they manifested Revenance to guide them to victory and gain quasi-immortality. They can no longer cheat death or return the lost with limited power since Grim Dawn. They still animate bodies, call upon spirits, and collect stories through blood.
Their communities are quite massive and multigenerational. They believe every person has a story worth telling. The collection of stories is integral for a community to thrive. Body modifications ensure their story survives them. Denizens may get tattoos, scarification, arcane runes, piercings, technological mods, and more. 
Revenites understand that everything in existence has a power worth using. They hold this belief beyond technology, magic, or even natural energy. They use the dead, their blood, bones, and ancestral spirits to continue the community. They are open to interacting with anybody from most communities. They tend to be the strictest on who may enter their settlements. 
Communities understand a person's value isn't in their actions but in their lives. Fields for organ harvest, bloody battles, and sanctuaries for rituals echo their sentiments. The power of Revenance allows the Revenites to collect the stories of the dead and bring them to life. Sometimes the effects of stories manifest through those that recount the memories.
 
TECHNOCRATS
“Someone, or something, built all that we know and what we don't. Understanding the fundamentals of the world around us means we can build it again, but better.”
Power comes from the willingness to push boundaries and do what others cannot. Technocrats hold a history of being conquerors and warmongers. They built a legacy of striving for levels of innovation beyond human potential. They use powerful weaponry and various forms of automation to maintain superiority. They raid locations for resources and technological components with unrivaled warriors and machinery. 
Technocrats connect to a force they believe transcends aether and magic. They learn how to hone and refine energy for practical industrial development. Before the Grim Dawn, the Technocrats drew upon Grim Light to create a fuel source known as Animarium. This allowed machines to operate with greater power. Such power sources lead to the creation of Vitamechs, massive pilotable machines. Access to Animarium has all but disappeared since the Grim Dawn. Technocrats drain remnant energy to craft within the limits of the material's potential. They may siphon from technological, industrial, and thaumaturgical sources.  
Their communities hold a sense of hierarchy and strict placements within their societies. The elites create, innovate, or contribute to advancements in knowledge and production. Common denizens are honest workers contributing daily labor for community stability. Basic labor ensures the elite save time and energy on what matters. Technocrat communities respect and honor those who provide the daily necessities. Desire to learn knew information creates an open mindset to outsiders.
 
MYTHOTERICS
“Darkness is nothing to be afraid of. Everything begins from nothing and returns to that. Fear is a power that overwhelms most, worried about the monster they can become. Wondering if the monster is who they are.”
Mythoterics have a dark history that few know but many experience the consequences. They must contend with a monster bound to them and their existence. Each day is a battle for control and dominance over their shared manifestation. They could unleash the monster and become a Cryptomach, or hidden warrior. Stories speak of the giant humanoid figure they could manifest in themselves.
The intensity of the monster inside has long diminished. Mythoterics now hold a beast's rage within. Some transform into the beast inside or conjure a beast akin to their own. Their connection to beasts and monsters allows a deep respect for the land they live in. The respect grows deeper with knowledge of the destruction they faced and created. They are guardians and wardens as self-proclaimed defenders of nature. 
Mythoteric communities explore the limits of magic and technology. Such exploration is a means to an end to control the monster inside them. Some see the beast as repentance for sin while others see the monster as a friend to aid them. They are a very inviting group and tend to have smaller settlements. Community members may journey out to help travelers or support settlements. They respond kindly to even fearful groups and Daemon Hearts. Settlements have psychological experts to tend to soldier and settlers dealing with despair.
 
AETHERNAUTS
“If you observe the world around you, the threads that bind reality become visible. Be curious, seek understanding, claim proof, and then recreate. Everything is possible, so even the truth can become temporary.”
The world belongs to the Aethernauts, and no one can stop them. That doesn't make them conquerors or dominators. They boast acceptance and tolerance that rivals the Erathans. Communities thrive around the principles of magical exploration and paradise. Aethernauts enthrall themselves in New Clear energy and the Grim Light it produces. They particularly focus on the whispers of unknown beings and ancient forces. Aethernauts once conjured Archons, great beings from other realms. They were conduits for powers of other worlds before the Grim Dawn.
Archons are no longer accessible to the Aethernauts in their current state. The limits of Aethernauts permit the usage of Daemonata and lost magic to surge through them. Aethernauts settle in odd places and adapt to strange environments. They establish settlements on open waters, peaks of mountains, and other obscure locations. Aethernauts connect to anywhere the land promises to have power for them to draw upon.
Communities refuse to adapt to the world's technology and prefer developing their resources. Aethernauts have access to magic and wish to gleam the world's truth as it once was. They know the first gift given by the stars was magic and flourished on that ideal. The goal remains to understand the state of the world and every detail about it. Knowledge sometimes becomes more valuable than food, shelter, or life itself for Aethernauts.
 
DAEMON HEARTS AND ARKANES
Grim Light changed and evolved certain beasts to become daemon-hearted creatures. People find concern in the humanoids that carry the same changes as these creatures. Many believe they were individuals near Ark Rifts and changed by the energy produced. Arkanes became the term to describe these magically mutated individuals. They have long since departed from the traditional communities that decorate the land. 
Arkane encounters reveal that they hunt for food and scavenge technology and thaumaturgy. Despite becoming monstrous, they still need food and water to survive. Sightings determine they also consume industrial and magical sources. Their language is foreign to the world with forms altered by magic and machinery. 
They maintain sentence and organization among themselves although appearing like feral humanoids. Arkanes have zealous behaviors and act with a terrifying level of aggressiveness. They are relentless in their violent approaches and considered walking calamities. Even in small numbers, they are a nightmarish force to reckon with.
 
LIGHT EATERS AND UMBRALS
The arrival of the Light Eaters relates to the appearance of the first Rifts. No one knows about the true origin of the Light Eaters other than their arrival in the world. They proceeded to multiply as they continued to grow and feed. Many of the first were harmless as they consumed residual Grim Light. 
One day the Light Eaters started attacking people and devouring the light in them. Little could stand against them other than objects powered by Grim Light. Even then, it took large forces and incredible might to best a small handful at a time. Their procreation outpaced the world's forces and the battle of attrition slipped away. 

EVERLASTING NIGHT AND GRIM DAWN
The Light Eaters were an overwhelming force of nature. Their consumption of Grim Light devoured the energy of the weapons used against them. This nightmarish event horizon consumed the daylight produced by the Astrum star. The absolute darkness, save for pale moonlight and artificial light, gave a sense of gloom. The world began to fall until humanity decided to use everything they had in a final effort.
All beings that held power from the Grim Forges called upon their sources. United they unleashed everything and assaulted the Light Eaters and their Hive. The resulting cataclysmic eruption shook the very realm. The Hive faced destruction and most of humanity paid the price. Without the Hive, all that remained of Light Eaters were wandering stragglers. Even the remnants of the Ark fragments vanished from the world. Only small rifts remained as reminders of the Ark and its fragments.

UMBRALINGS
What remains after the destruction of the Hive were those most affected by the Light Eaters. Beings once deprived of Grim Light became hopeless husks of their former selves. The humanoid husks wander about trying to find the things that once inspired them. Each follows some animalistic desire to seek the lights. Some are so far gone that the presence of a humanoid with Grim Light sends them into a frenzy. Whether driven by grief or rage, they assault humanoids and attempt to drain them of their light. The result of a Husk attack is corpses torn apart. Remains of a fruitless effort to scour the living for lost light.
People fear the Dusk Plague, an effect of the Grim Light after the Grim Dawn. A person starts to experience a state of energy degradation. Grim Light destroys a person from the inside without the natural energy to sustain them. Once this occurs, a hollowed vessel of their former selves remains, an Umbraling. Some keep sentience while still driven by a feral desire to return to being whole. They may gain more powers, abilities, and establish tactics in groups. They find any method necessary to find and recover light.
LINGERING NIGHTMARES
After the Grim Dawn, society was slow to restart. A hovering concern and fear that the end had come for them. The Light Eaters had diminished in numbers as the landscape experienced extensive changes. Some sought to discover where the Light Eaters came from and why they came. Others attempt to start their lives over or start new ones somewhere else. 
Generations continued and Light Eaters still posed a threat to the world. Their sights had become far and few between to the relief of many. People were more likely to encounter Umbralings in packs than a single Light Eater. Such facts couldn't prove to settle the nightmare that lingers on the land. The distinct despairing energy of Light Eaters remained despite reduced numbers. Their aura made ruins of old settlements and toxic environments of landmarks.
These dark nests manifest shadowy fragments made of malicious energy. Each expression of this darkness follows the desires of their despairing ancestors. A small teddy bear in a destroyed building may echo the joyful laughter it once created. The sound aims to lure in an unsuspecting traveler only to transform and feed on their light. Nightmares linger around every corner they turn. They remind people what they faced and what may one day return.

UNDERTAKERS
Daemon Hearts evoke fear in many for their might and ferocity. They are the byproduct of ambient Grim Light affecting individuals. The New Clear energy of the Grim Forges bestowed untold power upon the Keepers. Their connection permitted access to learning the techniques from the crystals. Daemons were leading members and chosen champions of the Keepers. Most gained energy to amplify techniques while Daemons had exclusive abilities.
Since the Grim Dawn, the Daemons had been all but eliminated. Some believe that some Daemons and Keepers had not perished. Instead, they faced the consequences of a sudden severance of their bonds to the Grim Forges. Grim Dawn evicted spirits that inhabited the Grim Forges and forced them to linger in the world. 
Ancient powers scattered as knowledge fragments and ethereal beings. Numina were the lost spirits of the Grim Forges, and not all were benevolent. A Numen may hold malicious intentions and manipulate seekers to perform twisted actions. Regardless of influence, claiming a Numen meant absorbing their memories, power, and potential. Many seek to find these fragments and remnants of the Daemons. The belief is that these omens are the only absolute resource to battle against Light Eaters. Those who seek said omens are the undertakers.
