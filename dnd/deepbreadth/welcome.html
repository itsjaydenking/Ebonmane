      Prepare to walk the streets of a modern world filled with technology while
      still wielding wondrous magic powers.

      Welcome to Cogitar (COH-jih-tahr), the Heart of Hiraeth (HEER-yth). This
      urban metropolis is a testament to humans and their growing ability, but
      that is how the Shadewalkers saw the world. Lightbearers knew the truth;
      fantastic beings began blending with this world, and only they could see
      the magic woven into the land. Advancements in technology, from the light
      switch that brings light to our houses to the intricate network in our
      mobile telecommunication devices, are all manifestations of powerful magic
      users.

    <h3>When the Veil Tore Open</h3>
    <p>
      It has been quite some time. Many still remember the day the boundary tore
      and the magic hidden among us was revealed. Humans obscured in the shade
      were forced to deal with a world larger than themselves all around them,
      while the beings bathed in the light had no choice but to collaborate with
      the magically deficient. Realms shattered, sending hundreds of thousands
      of beings into this one and sealing it away. Urgency made it important to
      work together as the fantastical creatures merged with the known world, as
      did their monsters and the following destruction. Creatures terrifying
      might sunder the land and eliminate much of society, leaving this as the
      last known bastion of civilization. Ignorance truly was bliss. We departed
      from the Ignolorian (ihg-NOH-lohr-ee-an) Era, the age of unknown horizons,
      and into what many consider the Melugium (Meh-LOO-zhee-uhm) Era, the age
      of restored balance.

    <h3>Where we Now Stand</h3>
    <p>
      From the outside of the city, it is a paradise for society. Lands have
      been torn apart by the monsters that roamed the land without substantial
      forces to drive them away. Death and destruction worldwide remain a
      distance away from the great metropolis. Corogus (coh-ROH-guhs) sits
      center as the downtown district where all major business takes place and
      is the only access to the government district of Aeorza (a-YOR-zuh) to the
      east across a lone bridge suspended above the massive river. Grimhaven is
      the core of industrialism and factories north of the center and opposite
      Rheinshire (RINE-shi-er) to the south, where it remains expensive but
      worthy of staying. Those lucky enough to be closer to the center find
      their greatest concern being traffic, although nothing stops criminals
      from trying their hand at fortune. However, people living west of the city
      center in Orion Heights are left with less than suitable living
      conditions. This is particularly true the further out one finds themselves
      of Grimhaven and Rheinshire. Safety exists as a wall at the edge, a
      boundary, and a symbol for what remains.
